# The first section of the configuration file refers to the
# input and output paths.
#
# Templer will process all files matching "*.skx" beneath a
# particular directory.  That directory is the input directory.
#
input = ./input/
#
##



##
#
# Within the input directory we'll process files that match
# a given suffix.
#
# By default this is ".skx", so we'll template-expand files
# named "index.skx", "about.skx", etc.
#
suffix = .wgn

##
#
# If we're working in-place then files will be expanded where
# they are found.
#
# This means that the following files will be created:
#
#   ./input/index.skx       -> input/index.html
#   ./input/foo/index.skx   -> input/foo/index.html
#   ..
#
#
# in-place = 1
#
##



##
#
# The more common way of working is to produce the output in a separate
# directory.
#
# NOTE:  If you specify both "in-place=1" and an output directory the former
#        will take precedence.
#
#
output = ./output/

#
# When pages are processed a layout-template will be used to expand the content
# into.
#
# Each page may specify its own layout if it so wishes, but generally we'd
# expect only one layout to exist.
#
# Here we specify both the path to the layout directory and the layout to use
# if none is specified:
#
#
layout-path = ./layouts/
layout      = default.layout
#

#
#  Anything below this is a global variable, accessible by name in your
# templates.
#
#  For example this:
#
#    copyright = &copy; Steve Kemp 2012
#
#  Can be used in your template, or you page text via:
#
#    <!-- tmpl_var name='copyright' -->

#
# If you wish to execute commands after building the
# site you may include an arbitrary number of keys called
# post-build.
